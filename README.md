# Biometric (Fingerprint based) Door Lock
Summer project under Dr.Raghu CV,NIT-Calicut

This repository contains files relating to a summer project i did, along with Alex John,Alex Joseph,Deepak M and Felix George, as students of NITC.
The aim of the prohect was to develop a fingerprint based door lock for the Embedded Systems Laboritory in the Electronics and Communication Dpartment
Block-I. This was to keep track of the students entering the lab during non-class hours, and facilitate their entry without the need for a lab-incharge to be 
present all the time. 

There is one more part for this project- that is the system side(PC) software written in python and using SQLLite to maintain a database of the enrolled stuednts
(Students and teachers whose fingerprint data has been stored in the device) to keep track of their entry and their details (Details include roll number, name, whether he/she is faculty
or student)
